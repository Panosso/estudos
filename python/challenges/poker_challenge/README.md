# Poker Python Challenge

This challenge will be propous by DATAH for teste my python skills.

# How to win

To solve this challenge, I created some methods that check the player's hand, and checking with is the most powerful game.

So the first step is to see if someone has the most powerful play, the royal straight flush. 

The application checks if any player has the game, if they both have the game, the suit will be the criteria of undraw. 

If no one does not have the royal straight flush, this project will validate the 2nd highest hand, which will be a straight flush, and successively until the game is decided by the highest card with the strongest suit.
